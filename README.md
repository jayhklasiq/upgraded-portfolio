# Overview

As a software engineer, my goal is to continuously improve my skills and expand my knowledge in the field of web development. To further this learning journey, I have created a web application that serves as a portfolio showcasing various projects I have worked on.

The web app features multiple pages, each highlighting a different project I have undertaken. It allows users to navigate through the projects, view project details, and access relevant information.

To start a test server on your computer, you can follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have Node.js installed on your system.
2. Clone the repository containing the web app code to your local machine.
3. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.
4. Run the command `pnpm install` to install the necessary dependencies.
5. After the installation is complete, run the command `pnpm run dev` to start the server.
6. Once the server is running, open a web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to see the first page of the app.

The purpose of developing this software is to create a platform where I can showcase my skills, projects, and experiences as a software engineer. It serves as a portfolio that potential employers or clients can explore to learn more about my capabilities and expertise in web development.

You can watch a demonstration of the software running and a walkthrough of the code in this [Software Demo Video](http://youtube.link.goes.here).

# Web Pages

1. **Home Page**: The home page provides an overview of the web app and introduces visitors to the various projects showcased. It dynamically displays project thumbnails or summaries to entice users to explore further.

2. **Project Pages**: Each project has its own dedicated page, accessible through the navigation menu or by clicking on the project thumbnail on the home page. These pages provide detailed information about the project, including its description, features, technologies used, and any other relevant details.

The web app transitions seamlessly between these pages, with intuitive navigation options allowing users to easily move between different sections and projects.

# Development Environment

For the development of this software, I used a combination of tools and technologies to streamline the development process and ensure efficient workflow.

- **Development Tools**: I utilized Visual Studio Code as my primary code editor for writing and debugging code. Git and GitHub were used for version control and collaboration with other team members if applicable.
- **Programming Language**: The web app was developed using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS for front-end development. Node.js and Express.js were used for server-side scripting and routing.

- **Libraries and Frameworks**: I incorporated various libraries and frameworks to enhance the functionality and aesthetics of the web app. This includes libraries such as Tailwind CSS for responsive design and EJS for server-side templating.

# Useful Websites

During the development process, I found the following websites helpful for reference, documentation, and troubleshooting:

- [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/)
- [Express.js Documentation](https://expressjs.com/)
- [Tailwind CSS Documentation](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation)
- [Google](https://google.com)

# Future Work

In the future, I plan to further enhance and refine the web app by addressing the following areas:

- Improving the design and user interface to create a more visually appealing and intuitive user experience.
- Optimizing the performance and loading speed of the web app to ensure smooth navigation and responsiveness on different devices and network conditions.
- Continuously updating and adding new projects to keep the portfolio up-to-date and reflective of my latest work and accomplishments.
